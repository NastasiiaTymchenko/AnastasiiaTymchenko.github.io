				<h3>Quality</h3>
				<p>
			All photos go through several stages of processing before getting into the hands of clients: selection, cropping, correction and retouching</p>
			<h3>Real emotions</h3>
			<p>I always try to display sincere emotions and sincere feelings.  I will put an emphasis on important details, interesting points and strengths</p>

		<div class="main">
				<h4>â€œAll photos are memento mori. Taking pictures means participating in the mortality, vulnerability, variability of another person (or thing). Precisely cutting off this moment and freezing it, all the photographs testify to the merciless melting of time. " My job is to preserve pleasant memories, the atmosphere of events in nature, in the city or in the studio. I also successfully handle various types of commercial projects.</h4>

			<h3>Speed</h3>
			<p>I do not make you wait 2 months for finished photos.  I need 2-3 weeks for full execution of the order, without loss of quality</p>
			<h3>Geography</h3>
			 <p>I take photographs not only in the territory of Poltava and the region, but also ready for business trips both in Ukraine and anywhere in the world.</p>
